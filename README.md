**🍏 Cider Free – The Ultimate Open-Source Cider Experience! �**  

🚀 **What is Cider Free?**  
Cider Free is a **lightweight, open-source** application designed to deliver a seamless and refreshing cider-tasting experience right from your device! Whether you're a cider enthusiast, a homebrewer, or just curious about different cider flavors, this tool helps you explore, track, and enjoy ciders like never before. **No ads, no subscriptions—just pure cider joy!**
